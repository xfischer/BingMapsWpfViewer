# BingMapsWpfViewer
BingMapsWpfViewer is a test project around Microsoft Bings Map WPF Control SDK.

It was mainly done because viewing SQL Server Spatial data is hard when data is not on standard projections, and was a great way to train myself on WPF.

The latest commit ensures the programs compiles and runs on WIN 10 / VS 2017 / .Net 4.6.1

It is now archived.
